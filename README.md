Welcome to DeFiZap! [www.DeFiZap.com]

Zap is a smart contract that auto-spreads incoming deposits across multiple DeFi protocols based on pre-set allocations, bypassing many manual steps. You can send your deposit to a Zap of your choosing and receive allocated tokens.

For example, Lender Zap allocates incoming deposits 90% to cDai and 10% to dLETH2x. Therefore, if you send 1 ETH to this Zap, you will receive 0.9 ETH's worth of cDai and place a 2X margin trade with 0.1 ETH on Fulcrum (giving you exposure to 0.2 ETH).

Right now only Lender Zap is available on the mainnet but many more coming soon. Weâ€™ve registered Lender.DefiZap.eth on The Ethereum Name Service so that investing into Compound + Fulcrum is as easy as sending a deposit from your wallet.

Ultimately, we intend to allow our users to be able to create their own Zaps, based on their custom requirements. In the meantime, you can submit a request as a new issue here in this format:

Name your Zap.
List of tokens you want to include in your Zap.
Allocation %s for each asset included.
